This code performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset (cbecs2018_final_public.csv) using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis includes loading and inspecting the dataset, identifying missing values, generating summary statistics, and visualizing relationships through heatmaps, distribution plots, count plots, box plots, and pairplots. It also performs groupby analysis to explore regional variations in electricity consumption, which is visualized through bar plots. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns within the data.
